<h2 class="xx-large color-primary">The Rock Panel Collection</h2>
<h3 class="medium color-secondary"><em>Save Time. Save Cost. Love Your Project.</em></h3>
<p>If you seek the appealing, three-dimensional look of stacked stone, look no further than Norstone Rock Panels, a <a href="/">natural stone veneer</a> cladding system which is ideal for <a href="/gallery/rock-panels/exteriors">exterior</a>
  <a href="/gallery/application/natural-stone-feature-walls"> feature walls</a>, pool surrounds, courtyards and entertainment areas. Equally well suited for <a href="/gallery/rock-panels/interiors">interior</a> use, these stacked stone panels are also
  perfect for <a href="/gallery/application/fireplace">natural stone fireplaces</a> or the creation of water features, especially when illuminated to highlight the color variations. And as they come in modular form, this stacked stone tile product is&nbsp;quick and easy to install
  on most structurally sound surfaces.</p>
<h3 class="medium color-secondary"><em>Four Brilliant Colors. Unique Norstone Design.</em></h3>
<p>Rock Panels are available in a selection of textures and four primary colors: the rustic, rugged appeal of <a href="/products/rock-panels/ochre">Ochre Blend</a>; the cool, subdued tones of <a href="/products/rock-panels/charcoal">Charcoal</a>; the warm,
  mellow hues of <a href="/products/rock-panels/ivory">Ivory Quartz</a>; and the sleek, contemporary styling of <a href="/products/rock-panels/white">White Quartz</a>. Handmade from select pieces of cut natural quartz or sedimentary rock, each natural stacked stone veneer&nbsp;panel is
  100% unique in color and design. Most importantly, these products are real stone veneer panels, meaning you compromise nothing in terms of the authenticity and durability of natural stone.</p>
<h3 class="medium color-secondary"><em>The World's Most Advanced Corner System.</em></h3>
<p>Corners are extremely important in any project, which is why Norstone prides itself on its innovation of the only two-part, finger-jointed corner system in the world. The inter-woven fingers deliver the most seamless look possible while our two-piece
  system upholds our promise of a hassle free installation. One section is longer than the other to allow an offset pattern to continue around the corner along the adjacent walls. Because they require little skill and time on the part of the contractors
  fixing our rock panels to a wall, they significantly reduce onsite labor costs, especially when compared to the time and skill involved in cutting and forming mitred corners.</p>

    <h4 class="color-primary">Natural Stone</h4>

      natural stone products can be used to create an integrated look of enduring style.  Norstone Rock Panels adhere to the following characteristics:</p>

  <div class="tabs-panel" id="panel3">
    <h4 class="color-primary">Applications</h4>
    <p>Beautifully textured with just a hint of roughness, these natural stone Rock Panels can be used to create innovative designs for any residential or commercial application. With their clean, simple and aesthetically pleasing lines, Norstone Rock Panels
      can transform a plain, uninspiring wall into a stunning feature wall, providing the simple yet defined geometry of a traditional stacked stone wall.</p>
    <p>Norstone Rock Panels are ideal for:
      <br>
      <a href="/gallery/rock-panels/interiors"> Interior</a> or <a href="/gallery/rock-panels/exteriors">Exterior</a> Applications, complimenting well with stainless steel, glass and wood / timber.

    <p><em>For more detailed installation instructions, please visit our <a href="/how-to-install-stacked-stone">installation guide</a>.</em></p>
    <h4 class="color-primary">Installation</h4>
    <p>One of the main benefits of Norstone Rock Panels is the ease with which they can be installed. The panel system provides for rapid installation over prepared cementitious surfaces, such as cement board, brick / block, or a traditional lathe and scratch
      coat using a polymer modified tile thinset. Rock Panels are ideally cut on a tile wet saw and are highly calibrated, allowing the installer to butt-join individual units together, thus eliminating the need to grout or point mortar between individual
      pieces or units.
      <br>
      <br> The beauty of the Rock Panel lies in its simplicity, and whether part of a large scale commercial application, or a small residential project, all levels of installers will find the Rock Panel quick and easy to install and a pleasure to work with.</p>
    <h4 class="color-primary">Natural Stone Sealer</h4>
    <p>A natural stone sealer can be applied depending on the characteristics of the application or to achieve a desired look or finish.</p>
