  heading: Not One Detail Overlooked.
  body: Interlocking Finger Joints are the only proven method for creating a truly seamless finish along the corner. Norstone's patent-pending Fingerjoint Corner System, which is available for all our <a href="/products/">Wall Panel Products</a>, consists of two smaller panels which join together at the corner to create the perfect corner treatment. Each pair is <em>built together</em> at the same time. This ensure a seamless fit every time.</p><p><a href="/products/rock-panels/white/">Visit Product Page</a>
